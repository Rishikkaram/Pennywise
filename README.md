# Pennywise: Your Smart Money Mentor

Pennywise is a smart, interactive personal finance tracker and advisor built with Streamlit. This application goes beyond basic expense tracking by integrating machine learning and large language models to provide valuable financial insights, emotional spending analysis, and future projections.
